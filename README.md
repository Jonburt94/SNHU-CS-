How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs through thorough questioning and conversation with the client. I seek what the client searches for, and place it into a template known as a user story. The user story is a basic template consisting of: As a(n) <type of user>, I want to <perform some task>, so that I can <achieve some goal>. Through the user story, I can better implement the clients' needs into a program since I have a better understanding of exactly what features they desire.


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by first understanding the purpose of the program, what is it intended to do? I must first understand this to know what features to implement otherwise I'm just sensibly programming towards no true goal or purpose. I hope to incorporate the Scrum-agile processes I have learned throughout the CS-250 course in my future development work as I have grown fond of the framework and processes.

These values summarize what it means to be a storng team player. A member should be committed to the project, focused on tasks at-hand, respectful to his team and organization, and have the courage to perform his tasks and receieve and offer feedback to the team.
